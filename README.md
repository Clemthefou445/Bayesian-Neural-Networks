This repository aims at replicating results of the paper ["Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05424.pdf) by Blundell et al, 2015. In addition to that, we ra several experiments such as running the model on Out-of-Distribution Data or an Adversarial Attacks analysis. <br /> <br /> 
This work was carried out as part of a project at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin and in collaboration with Denis Semko Androsenko.<br /> <br />  Please consider the 3 documents covering our whole research study:
